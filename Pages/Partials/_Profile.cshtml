<div class="personal-description">
    As a full-stack developer, I am very detail oriented in my approach, and firmly believe that taking the time to do something right is much more important than reworking it several times (although that is also acceptable as new information comes to us with usage of our software). Also, I believe it is important that everyone has basic understanding of the vision and the big picture so that we can prepare ourselves in coding for the things to come in the future. I have worked in several teams and been a valuable member of each one of them, working alongside my more experienced colleagues and mentoring the less experienced ones.
